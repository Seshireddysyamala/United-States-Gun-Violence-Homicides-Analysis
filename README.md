# United-States-Gun-Violence-Homicides-Demographical-Analysis
This repository contains the complete analysis of gun violence homicides across the United States. The project leverages advanced data visualization and analytical techniques to uncover trends, demographic disparities, and correlations between gun ownership, socioeconomic factors, and homicide rates. 

## Project Overview
Gun violence is a pressing issue in the United States. This project aims to provide actionable insights by analyzing homicide data through multiple dimensions, including age, race, state policies, and socioeconomic factors. The results are presented using interactive dashboards created in Tableau, enabling data-driven decision-making for policymakers and community leaders.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Developed in Tableau, featuring:
  - Heat maps showing state-wise homicide rates per 100,000 population.
  - Scatter plots exploring correlations between gun sales, ownership, and homicide rates.
  - Demographic breakdowns of age- and race-specific homicide rates.
  - Line charts illustrating trends over time.
- **Data Normalization**: All data normalized to provide meaningful comparisons, including per capita calculations for population groups.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Insights into the relationship between socioeconomic factors (GDP per capita) and gun violence.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes multiple authoritative datasets, including:
1. **FBI NICS Firearm Background Checks**
   - State-wise firearm sales data as a proxy for gun ownership trends.
2. **UCR Supplemental Homicide Report (SHR)**
   - Detailed homicide data by year, state, victimâ€™s age, and race.
3. **Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions**
   - Annual data on firearm-related deaths and demographics.
4. **World Population Review**
   - Gun ownership rates by state.
5. **Visual Capitalist**
   - GDP per capita by state for socioeconomic analysis.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Duplicates removed, missing values handled, and data formats standardized.
2. **Data Normalization**: Calculated per capita rates (e.g., homicides per 100,000 population) to enable fair comparisons.
3. **Visualization**: Created interactive and visually engaging dashboards using Tableau.
4. **Analysis**: Examined correlations between gun violence and factors such as gun sales, GDP per capita, and demographics.

## Key Findings
- **Regional Disparities**: States like Louisiana and Missouri have the highest homicide rates, while Massachusetts and Hawaii have the lowest.
- **Demographic Impact**: Young adults (ages 20-40) and Black or African American communities are disproportionately affected.
- **Socioeconomic Factors**: States with lower GDP per capita exhibit higher gun violence rates.
- **Weapon Type**: Handguns are the most common weapon, involved in over 54% of gun-related homicides.

## Recommendations
- Implement stricter handgun regulations to address the high prevalence of handguns in homicides.
- Target community-based programs to support vulnerable age groups and racial demographics.
- Address socioeconomic disparities to mitigate underlying causes of gun violence.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Tableau**: Primary tool for data visualization.
- **Python**: Used for data preprocessing and cleaning.
- **Datasets**: Publicly available data from FBI, Johns Hopkins, World Population Review, and Visual Capitalist.
